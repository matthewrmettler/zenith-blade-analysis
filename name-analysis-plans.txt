An Analysis of Numbered Summoner Names
-Look at the percentage of summoner names that contain numbers
-Look at how usernames with numbers are distributed by league; how many are veterans; how many games they have played; versus non-numbered names
-Look at the most popular numbers used by summoners
-For the top x most popular numbers,  see their distribution by league, whether they are veterans, see what kinds of champions and roles they enjoy playing
-(Maybe) Extrapolate from numbers like 80-00 ages of players based on birth year (ie, 91 might mean they were born in 1991). Gauge age distribution across leagues

Other Future Ideas
-Look at the distribution of username lengths
-Look at how many names have spaces
-(Hard) Look at what words are frequently used
